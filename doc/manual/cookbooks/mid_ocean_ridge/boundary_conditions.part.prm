subsection Boundary velocity model
  # To model the divergent velocitiy field of a mid-ocean ridge, we prescribe 
  # the plate velocity (pointing away from the ridge) at the top boundary. 
  # We use a closed boundary with free slip conditions as the left boundary, which 
  # marks the ridge axis and also acts as a center line for our model, so that 
  # material can not cross this boundary. 
  # And finally, we prescribe the lithostatic pressure as a boundary traction on 
  # the bottom and right side of the model, so that material can flow in and out 
  # accordning to the flow induced be the moving plate.

##################### Velocity ########################

# We prescribe the velocity at the top boundary using a function:
# At the ridge axis, the velocity is zero, at a distance of 10 km from the ridge
# axis or more, the rigid plate uniformly moves away from the ridge with a constant 
# speed, and close to the ridge we interpolate between these two conditions.
