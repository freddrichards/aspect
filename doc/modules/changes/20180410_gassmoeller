Removed: The 'Model settings' subsection in the parameter file has been
removed. It contained a selection of parameters that conceptually belonged to
other subsections and were never moved to the correct places. The update script
in doc/update_prm_files_to_2.0.0.sed was updated to correctly identify and move
these parameters to their new subsections, and all files in the repository have
been updated using this script.
