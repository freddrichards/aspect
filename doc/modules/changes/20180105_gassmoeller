Changed: The boundary velocity plugins are now controlled by
a manager class that allows assigning several plugins at the same boundary. 
This behavior is identical to the boundary temperature and boundary
composition plugins with the additional possibiltiy of assigning different
plugins to different boundaries, and only prescribing certain
components of the velocity.
