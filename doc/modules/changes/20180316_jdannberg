Overhaul of the melt simple material model. 
Fixed: The freezing of melt in the melt simple material model is 
now more consistent: The freezing rate parameter determines the 
freezing of all melt, and melt freezes if both the porosity and 
the depletion are larger than the equilibrium melt fraction. 
Changed: The melt simple material model can now only be used
with operator splitting.
