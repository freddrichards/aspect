New: Two new nonlinear solvers are now available: a defect correction Picard 
iteration and a Newton iteration nonlinear solver, both available trough the 
nonlinear solver called <code>Newton Stokes</code>.
<br>
The defect correction Picard (also called approximate Newton) iteration usually 
follows the same convergence pattern as the normal Picard iteration (linear 
convergence), but due to it's defect correction form can be more accurate and 
can make use of the Eisenstat Walker (1994) method of determining the optimal 
linear tolerance. It can be used by setting the <code>Max pre-Newton nonlinear 
iterations</code> larger or equal to the <code>Max nonlinear iterations</code> 
and the <code>Nonlinear Newton solver switch tolerance</code> to an unreachable 
tolerance.

The Newton iteration is a defect correction Picard which also uses the 
derivatives of the viscosity to the strain-rate and viscosity to the pressure 
to converge faster to the correct solution. In contrast to the (defect 
correction) Picard iteration, this iteration is not globally convergent. This 
means that only when the current solution is close enough to the real solution, 
the iteration converges quadratically. In many cases it is therefore advisable 
to first perform a few defect correction Picard iteration, before turning on 
the Newton solver.
<br>
Because the linear system resulting from the Newton iteration is not always 
stable (Symmetric Positive Definite), we have options available to stabilize 
it (see Fraters et al., in prep). This stabilization prevents the linear 
iterative solver from crashing by forcing the system to be SPD, but may slow 
down the convergence. We therefore implemented an option for a fail safe, 
which automatically turns on the stabilization when the linear solver crashes.
