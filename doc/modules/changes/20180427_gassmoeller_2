Changed: The default value for AdditionalSeismicOutputs was changed from -1 to
a signaling Nan. This ensures that every plugin that creates seismic outputs
needs to use a material model that actually fills those outputs. Note that the
'depth average' postprocessor now only outputs seismic velocity columns if they
are available. If they are not available, but explicitly requested, the
postprocessor will throw an error, and if 'all' quantities are requested the
seismic velocities will only be written if provided by the material model.
Previously, the columns were always written and filled with -1 if no velocities
were available.
