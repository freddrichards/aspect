Changed: A number of Stokes solver parameters have been moved from the global
namespace into the subsection 'Solver parameters/Stokes solver parameters'.
The advection and composition solver tolerances have also been moved to the
'Solver parameters' subsection. The update script was improved to handle all
changes automatically.
