Changed: All of the nonlinear solver schemes have been renamed:
IMPES -> single Advection, single Stokes
Stokes only -> no Advection, iterated Stokes
iterated Stokes -> single Advection, iterated Stokes
Newton Stokes -> iterated Advection and Newton Stokes
iterated IMPES -> iterated Advection and Stokes
Advection only -> single Advection, no Stokes
The old names still work, but should be considered as deprecated.
