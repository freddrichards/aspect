Fixed: The melt simple model now correctly always uses the Thermal 
bulk viscosity exponent parameter to compute the temperature 
dependence of the compaction/bulk viscosity (instead of the Thermal 
viscosity exponent that describes the temperature dependence of 
the shear viscosity, which was used before in certain cases and 
was not the correct parameter for the computation).
