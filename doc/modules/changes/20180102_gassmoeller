New: A new material model 'damage rheology' is added.
This model uses a compositional field to store and evolve a
quantity that represents the grain size, which influences
the viscosity. All other material properties can be read from 
data tables generated by Perplex or Hefesto, or set in a similar
way to the 'simple' material model. Details about the model
are available in Dannberg et al., 2017 in G-Cubed.
