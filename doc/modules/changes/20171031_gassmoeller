New: There is a new cmake option ASPECT_COMPARE_TEST_RESULTS,
which allows to run the test suite without comparing its results.
This is useful for other machines than the reference tester, and to
check if one of the tests crashes. The option defaults to ON, which
preserves the old behavior of comparing the results.
