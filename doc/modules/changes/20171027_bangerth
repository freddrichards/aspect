Fixed: A forgotten factor of 2 in assembling the preconditioner for
the Stokes equation, and a forgotten term for compressible models, 
led to a suboptimal performance of the solver. The
answers were always correct, but it took more iterations than
necessary. This is now fixed, and results in significantly fewer
GMRES iterations when solving the Stokes equations.
