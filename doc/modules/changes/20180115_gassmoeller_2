Fixed: The 'heat flux map' visualization postprocessor used to compute
the heat flux through every boundary face and average the computed fluxes per
cell. At side boundaries of boxes the computed flux usually makes no sense,
and one is usually only interested in the surface or bottom heat flux. Thus
the plugin was changed to only compute fluxes at top and bottom boundaries.
