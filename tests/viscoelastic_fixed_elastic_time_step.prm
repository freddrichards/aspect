# This test checks viscoelastic stress buildup with a
# constant strain rate and an elastic time step equal
# to a user-specified constant elastic time step. This
# fixed elastic time step is double the numerical time step. 
# Viscoelastic stresses (sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_xy) 
# are tracked with compositional fields.
